# Authentication

<!-- XXX _users_ should log in and have access to all of their _characters_
but meh I'm lazy -->

Intrinsic to the definition of a Character is a hashed passphrase, and some
salt.

Operations that require the Character's permissions can only be performed
*by* the character (except in the case of wizardry).
